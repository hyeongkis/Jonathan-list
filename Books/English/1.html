      <h2><a href="https://www.flatstanleybooks.com/" style=color:blue;><u>FLAT STANLEY</u></a></h2>
      <p><span class="first">Flat Stanley</span> is an American children's book series written by author Jeff Brown (January 1, 1926 – December 3, 2003). The idea for the book began as a bedtime story for Brown’s sons, which
        Brown turned into the first Flat Stanley book. The first book featured illustrations by Tomi Ungerer and was published in 1964. Brown did not continue the series until more than two decades later, when he published five more books: Stanley
        and the Magic Lamp, Stanley in Space, Stanley’s Christmas Adventure, Invisible Stanley, and Stanley, Flat Again! By 2003, the Flat Stanley series had sold almost a million copies in the United States, and the stories had been translated into
        French, German, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, and Hebrew. Since Brown's death in 2003, other children's book authors, including Sara Pennypacker and Josh Greenhut, have continued the series under a new name, Flat Stanley's Worldwide Adventures.
